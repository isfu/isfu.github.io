    <h3>How I listen to music</h3>
    <p>
      I pay for Apple Music and listen through the app on my phone. I'd rather
      use Spotify, but I got a deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      I always listen to music through headphones, never through the phone
      speakers.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a song comes on that I don't like, I'll skip it. It could take a few
      seconds of skipping to find a song I'm in the mood for.

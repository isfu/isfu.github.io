    <p>Hi, I'm Futura.</p>
    <p>
      I program, play games, listen to podcasts and music, and attend high
      school.
    </p>
    <p>If you want to talk, my Discord is <code>Futura#5692</code></p>
    <p>
      This website is made with pure
      <a href="https://github.com/isfu/isfu.github.io">HTML/CSS/JavaScript</a>,
      and hosted on <a href="https://github.io">Github Pages</a>. The domain is
      from <a href="https://hover.com">Hover</a>, and I configured the DNS there
      too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time to fill the rest of the page with images because I hate CSS and can't
      stick the darn footer at the bottom.
